# Playground

Playground is a single-user, throwaway-grade browser app for brainstorming with "Mary," an
AI Business Analyst who facilitates structured ideation techniques (Job to Be Done, Five Whys,
How Might We, and five more) over a streaming chat, behind a one-password gate — no database,
no accounts, no persistence beyond the current browser tab in this first slice.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PLAYGROUND_PASSWORD` | yes | — | The one password that unlocks the app |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | yes | — | Random secret used to HMAC-sign the auth cookie |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | only if using Gemini | — | Google Generative Language API key |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | no | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Gemini model id |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | only if using OpenRouter | — | OpenRouter API key |
| `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | no | `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` | OpenRouter model id (pick any free-tier model) |
| `OPENROUTER_MULTIMODAL` | no | `false` | Force image/PDF support on for OpenRouter. See [Attachments](#attachments-images-pdfs-docs--voice). |
| `DATABASE_URL` | no (optional) | — | Neon Postgres connection string. **Unset → the app runs exactly as before** (ephemeral, in-tab conversations). Set + migrated → conversations and history persist. |
| `BUDGET_USD` | no | `10` | Monthly spend cap (USD). A safety net, not accounting — cost is **estimated** from a small per-model price table. Requires `DATABASE_URL`; with no DB there's no metering or cap. |
| `PLAYGROUND_ENGINE` | no | *(off)* | **Experimental.** Unset/off → the brainstorming chat uses the hardcoded Mary prompt (the default, unchanged). Set to `on` → the same conversation runs through the **runtime engine** (`lib/runtime/*`), executing the real `bmad-brainstorming` SKILL.md instead. See [Runtime engine](#runtime-engine-experimental). |
| `PLAYGROUND_TREE` | no | *(off)* | **Experimental.** Unset/off → the app is **byte-identical to today** (Mary is the single front door). Set to `on` → the browser shows the full **agent→command tree** (every BMad agent + command). See [Agent→command tree](#agentcommand-tree-experimental). |
| `WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER` | no | — | Free/keyless web-search tier for research commands (Epic D). Unset → research commands degrade honestly. **Never a paid API.** |
| `AUTH_MODE` | no | `shared` | `shared` (default) → today's single shared password, no accounts, byte-identical. `multi` → admin-provisioned **multi-user** mode: per-user accounts + private per-user conversations. **Requires `DATABASE_URL`.** See [Multi-user mode](#multi-user-mode-experimental). |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | only if `AUTH_MODE=multi` | — | Username of the bootstrapped admin (seeded once when no admin exists). |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | only if `AUTH_MODE=multi` | — | Initial admin password (bootstrap only; change it after first sign-in at `/account`). |

## Budget cap (optional, requires a database)

When `DATABASE_URL` is set, each billable chat completion writes an **estimated** usage
row (provider, model, token counts, cost) and the header shows a `$spent / $cap` meter for
the current calendar month. Cost is estimated from a small, builder-tunable price table
(`lib/usage.ts`) using provider-reported token counts (Gemini `usageMetadata`, OpenRouter
final-chunk `usage`) or a ~4-chars/token fallback — treat it as a guardrail, not a bill.

- At **80%** of the cap you get a one-time warning.
- At **100%**, a billable request is **blocked** with an honest bubble suggesting a free model.
- **Free OpenRouter models** (id ending `:free`) are never counted and **always work**, even at 100%.
- Unknown/untabled models cost 0, so they never block.

## Runtime engine (experimental)

By default, Mary's brainstorming prompt is composed by `lib/mary.ts` (the "hardcoded" path)
and streamed straight from the provider. Setting `PLAYGROUND_ENGINE=on` instead routes the
brainstorming conversation through the **runtime engine** (`lib/runtime/*` — `runWorkflow`),
which executes the actual `bmad-brainstorming` `SKILL.md` (adapted for the browser) with one
documented adapter layered on top: the shared **app-protocol block** (`APP_PROTOCOLS` in
`lib/mary.ts` — chips, `<document>`, honest-limits, attachments, `@refer`). Mary's
persona/framing/stance come from the loaded BMad files, not hand-written copy.

- **Off (default):** the app is byte-identical to today. Nothing about the chat changes.
- **On:** the same chat runs through the engine. Chips, the technique buttons, the document
  pane, markdown, attachments, `@refer`, and the budget meter all still work. A checkpoint
  (the engine HALTing to wait for you) shows a light "Mary is waiting on you" affordance.

The flag ships **off**; flip it only after an in-browser parity pass. With a database
configured, the engine persists resumable run state to `workflow_runs` (cross-session).

## Agent→command tree (experimental)

By default Playground has one front door: Mary and her brainstorming. Setting
`PLAYGROUND_TREE=on` reveals the full **agent→command tree** — every BMad agent
(Mary, John, Winston, Sally, the CIS crew…) and every command in each agent's
menu, rendered **entirely from the skill manifest** (`getManifest()`) plus a
checked-in **capability registry** (`lib/agents/capabilities.ts`). There is no
per-agent TypeScript: add or rename an agent in `.claude/skills/**` and the tree
changes with no code edit.

- **Parity is data, not vibes.** Each command carries a `verified` / `unverified`
  status. Only `verified` commands launch on the engine; the rest render
  **greyed-but-visible** (you see everything each agent *can* do) and, when
  tapped, show an honest "not wired up here yet" bubble and drop a builder note.
  The seed ships **only** `bmad-agent-analyst`/`BP` (brainstorming) verified —
  the C-4-proven path. Flip a command live by adding it to the seed **with a
  documented in-browser parity pass**.
- **Launch reuses the engine.** A `skill`-backed command runs `runWorkflow(...)`
  exactly as brainstorming does (same adapter + persona composition + app
  protocols); a `prompt`-backed command runs its prompt text as the launch turn.
- **Handoff.** When a workflow finishes with a `<document>`, verified-only
  handoff chips can carry that artifact into another agent's command with it
  pre-`@refer`'d (FR-38).
- **Research** commands use a free/keyless web-search tier (`WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER`)
  and degrade honestly when unconfigured — never a paid API.

The flag ships **off**; with it off the app is byte-identical to today. Flip it
only after an in-browser pass (same discipline as `PLAYGROUND_ENGINE`).

## Multi-user mode (experimental)

By default the app uses one **shared password** (`PLAYGROUND_PASSWORD`) — no
accounts, everyone shares one space. Set **`AUTH_MODE=multi`** (needs
`DATABASE_URL`) to switch to **admin-provisioned accounts with private per-user
data**:

- **Bootstrap:** the first sign-in (or `npm run db:migrate`) seeds a single admin
  from `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` when none exists.
- **Admin** (`/admin`): create accounts (a one-time password is shown to hand
  over) and **reset** a user's password (new one-time password) — the admin never
  sees an existing password. No public signup.
- **Users** change their own password at `/account`.
- **Isolation:** each person sees only their own conversations, documents, notes,
  and `@`-references. The admin manages accounts but **cannot read** others' chats.
- Passwords are **scrypt-hashed + salted** (`node:crypto`, no dependency); the
  session is a signed cookie verified on the edge.

Ships **off** (`shared`); flip `AUTH_MODE=multi` + set the admin env in your host
after a pass. Shared mode stays byte-identical.

## Builder notes outbox

When Mary says something is *"noted for the builder"*, the excerpt is captured. With a
database configured it persists to the `builder_notes` table (visible across devices via the
📮 drawer); select notes and **Send to builder** flips them to a builder-visible "Sent" tab.
With no database it falls back to browser-local storage, exactly as before.

## Attachments (images, PDFs, docs) + voice

The composer has a 📎 attach button (images `png/jpeg/webp/gif`, `application/pdf`, and
`text/plain` / `text/markdown`) and a 🎙 voice button. Limits: **10MB per file, up to 4 files**;
oversize/unsupported files raise a toast and aren't attached.

- **Text/markdown docs** are read in the browser and **inlined** into the message
  (`[Attached: name]\n<content>`) — so they work on **any** model.
- **Images and PDFs** are sent as provider-native multimodal parts.
- **Voice** uses the browser's Web Speech API (`webkitSpeechRecognition`/`SpeechRecognition`) to
  transcribe speech into the input — no audio bytes ever leave the browser. If the browser lacks
  the API, a toast says so.
- Only lightweight **attachment metadata** (filename, mime type, size) is persisted on the message
  row; binaries are ephemeral (a refreshed thread shows a `📎 filename` chip, not the image).

### Which models can read images/PDFs?

Not every model is multimodal, so the app **gates by capability** and warns before sending:

| Provider | Image / PDF support |
|---|---|
| **Gemini** | Always (images + PDFs). |
| **OpenRouter** | **Text-only by default.** Enabled only if `OPENROUTER_MODEL` matches a known-vision allowlist — model ids containing `gpt-4o`, `claude-3`, `gemini`, `llama-3.2-vision`, `qwen…-vl`, or `pixtral` — **or** `OPENROUTER_MULTIMODAL=true`. |

If you attach an image/PDF while on an OpenRouter model that can't read it, the send is **blocked**
with a toast ("switch to Gemini … or set a vision-capable model") and the attachment is kept —
never silently dropped. Text-doc attachments never trigger this. The allowlist lives in
`lib/attachments.ts` (`OPENROUTER_VISION_PATTERNS`) and is builder-tunable.

> **Schema note:** attachment metadata lives in a `messages.attachments jsonb` column. Because
> `db/schema.sql` is applied with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (no `ALTER`), the column is created
> automatically only on a **fresh** database. On an **already-migrated live DB**, add it once with:
> `ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS attachments jsonb;`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values you plan to use. You only need keys for the
provider(s) you intend to select in the UI's model toggle — the other can be left blank.

## Persistence (optional)

Persistence is **off by default** and entirely optional — with no `DATABASE_URL` the app behaves
exactly like the stateless version (conversations live only in the browser tab). To turn on saved
conversations and message history:

1. **Provision Neon** — create a project at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and copy its pooled
   connection string (looks like `postgres://user:pass@ep-xxx.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`).
2. **Set `DATABASE_URL` locally** — add it to `.env`.
3. **Run the migration** — `npm run db:migrate`. This applies `db/schema.sql` (idempotent
   `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`), creating the full v2 schema.
4. **Set `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel** — add it to the project's environment variables
   (Production + Preview), then redeploy. Run `npm run db:migrate` once against the same database.

When enabled, the sidebar lists your saved conversations (newest first), clicking one rehydrates its
full thread, and **New conversation** creates a fresh row without deleting the previous one. If the
database is ever unreachable, the app degrades gracefully to ephemeral behavior rather than erroring.

> **Schema note:** `db/schema.sql` is a **fresh-schema definition** applied by `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
> EXISTS` — `npm run db:migrate` does not ALTER existing tables. The `messages.seq` identity column
> (which guarantees user-before-assistant ordering within a single write transaction) is part of this
> definition, so migrate against a clean database. If you already created the tables from an earlier
> draft of this schema, drop them (or use a fresh Neon branch) before re-running the migration.

## Local run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`, log in with `PLAYGROUND_PASSWORD`, and start brainstorming.

## Tests & build

```bash
npm test    # vitest — chips parser, auth cookie sign/verify, technique draw-two
npm run build
```

## Vercel deploy

1. Import this repo into Vercel (root directory — it's a standard Next.js App Router project).
2. Set the environment variables above in the Vercel project settings (Production + Preview).
3. Deploy. No build-step configuration is needed beyond the default `next build`.
4. There is no database — conversation history lives only in the browser tab for this slice.
